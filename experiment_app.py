    Thank you for completing this short trivia survey!

    This study is part of a research project investigating how visual cues (like unrelated photos) and different kinds of reasoning (explanation vs. emotion) affect peopleâ€™s perception of truth.

    Some of the statements you saw were factually accurate, while others were not. And some were accompanied by images that were not directly related to the content.

    By analyzing how people respond under different conditions, we hope to better understand how misinformation spreads online â€” especially when it's paired with persuasive visuals.

    Your responses have been recorded anonymously and will help support research in cognitive psychology and digital media literacy.

    If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to the research team at **aw3088@columbia.edu**. Thank you again!
